A boilerplate API app written in TypeScript to learn [Koa.js](https://koajs.com/)

While it didn't start out this way, this project eventually morphed into a clone of [koalerplate](https://github.com/dbalas/koalerplate) in TypeScript

## Development

1. Install the latest versions of `node` and `yarn`
1. Clone this repo
1. `yarn` to install packages
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill out the `PORT`
1. `yarn dev` to run. The command uses `tsc-watch`, which will only start the server if the typescript compiles without errors
